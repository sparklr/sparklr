# Sparklr
Source code of the [Sparklr.me](http://sparklr.me/) social networking site.

Sparklr is an open communication website designed to enable people to communicate in realtime, spur of the moment style.

## About the code
Sparklr, or sometimes known as "prototype 18," is a project I started building during my senior year of high school. It's been through several iterations since then, and has been rewritten from the ground up in Node.js, as an experiment in simplicity and efficiency.

Because the primary goal of Prototype 18 was to learn as much as possible, a couple instances of "reinventing the wheel" exist. Despite this being impractical in a rapid build scenario, p18 has been an amazing full-stack learning experiment.

## Hacking

Sparklr is now licensed under GPLv3, so you can hack around it as you see fit, under those terms. As for contributions, I'm trying to run the project solo with my bestfriend right now, just for the sake of learning. We'll see how this changes, but feel free to submit issues or feature requests.

## Shameless plugs

Sparklr is developed by [Jonathan Warner (jaxbot)](https://github.com/jaxbot) and [Ivey Padgett (iveysaur)](https://github.com/iveysaur), Computer Science students at UCF.
