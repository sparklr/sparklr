			<h1>Sparklr Etiquette</h1>
			These are a set of rules, a code of behavior that the citizens of Sparklr abide by. They are not strictly rules, but rather guidelines for not looking like a punk.<br>
			<h2>Comment, don't repost</h2>
			...in cases where you are directly responding to a person. When you repost, you share it with your followers and other people on the feeds. If you have something to add, go ahead and repost! But if you're simply trying to direct a, idk, comment at the poster, comments are the preferred method of communication.
			<h2>Combine posts</h2>
			The character limit on Sparklr is 500 chars. That's a lot of room for expansion! If you want to share something that has multiple lines, hold shift or control while pressing enter to insert a newline. Combining interrelated thoughts keeps the feed clean and makes commenting and reading easier, especially since the feeds are not necessarily chronological.
			<h2>Communicate with others</h2>
			This one is big. Sparklr is a big family of people, wanting to communicate on a variety of subjects. It's a big plus to say hi, chat about things, make friends, extra. You don't want to be ignored any more than the next person, so play along. ;)
