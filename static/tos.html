			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			The Terms of Service is an agreement between the user, you, and the service, Sparklr.
			It's basically fancy talk for "rules for using this site."
			<br><br>
			We'll try to keep this short and sweet. If you have any questions, concerns, etc., feel free to contact us at app@sparklr.me.
			<br><br>
			By using Sparklr ("the website", "the service", "we", "our", "Sparklr.me"), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions, you cannot use Sparklr.
			<br><br>
			<h2>These terms may change as the service changes or grows</h2>
			We have to cover ourselves. If we find we need to change these terms, we will notify you before hand.
			<br><br>

			<h2> You must be 13 years or older to use Sparklr.</h2>
			For legal reasons. Sorry.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Access to Sparklr and/or its content can change at any time</h2>
			We will do our best to notify users of any changes to the service, but as the service evolves, we must reserve the right to change how the service works, what it does, how it is accessed, et cetera.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Keep us out of trouble</h2>
			You agree to indemnify Sparklr, its users, its creators, and anyone affiliated with the service, name, etc. We, the creators, offer no warranty. Also, if you get hurt, incur damages, or something to that tune, its not our fault. Plain and simple. 
			<br><br>

			<h2>No illegal content </h2>
			Any and all content you share or submit to Sparklr must be legally your content or within the bounds accepted under copyright law. You cannot submit content that you do not own, or do not have permission to use. We reserve the right to remove any such content. We also waive any claims about such content to you. Simply put, if you submit a copyrighted picture of Justin Bieber and the men in big suits come after us, we hold you accountable for submitting illegal content. Guys in big suits, you know how this works.
			<br><br>

			Also, all content submitted must be considered legal under United States laws. You cannot submit, share, etc., any content that would be illegal within this country. Examples are, but are not limited to, child pornography, threatening messages, hate speech, etc. Such content is not to be submitted to Sparklr.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Privacy</h2>

			Sparklr ("we", "us", "our") take your privacy very seriously. This section serves as our privacy policy for the service, and details what information we collect and what we do with it.
			<br><br>

			<h2> What we collect </h2>
			We don't collect anything that you don't give us. We aren't tracking you, and we certainly are not selling your data to anyone. That would be totally uncool.
			<br><br>

			What we do collect, however, is any information you submit regarding your account, i.e. email address, username, display name. Your password is hashed using bcrypt, which is a mathematically irreversible hashing algorithm and a very expensive one to brute force. We never store the plain text version of your password. That would be really stupid and irresponsible, and you should smack anyone you see who does that.
			<br><br>

			We also collect any data you post to your account. That's pretty much implied with any social sharing service; if you submit data to your account, the data is stored on our server. This being said, you retain all ownership of your data, and have the right to remove it at any time.
			<br><br>

			Also, for right now, we have Google Analytics enabled. If you don't like that, feel free to block it. It provides us with little numbers that are sometimes helpful and sometimes just look pretty. It's a goal to get rid of it, because it slows things down.
			<br><br>

			Again, we take privacy seriously (unlike most companies who have way more information than we do) and will notify you if any changes are necessary to this privacy policy.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Be a decent person </h2>
			We reserve the right to remove or suspend any user from the service who causes any other users to feel unwelcome, threatened, unsafe, etc. You don't have to love everyone, but you certainly don't have to try and harm others, either.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Get off my lawn </h2>
			We reserve the right to remove or suspend any user at any time, for any reason. We also reserve the right to disable access to Sparklr and its related services to anyone for any reason. If you think that sounds harsh, try reading any other terms of service.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Have fun</h2>
			While having fun is not a requirement for using the services, ending the TOS document on a grim note seemed depressing, so this paragraph exists purely for the sake of padding.
