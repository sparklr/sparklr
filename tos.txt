The Terms of Service is an agreement between the user, you, and the service, Sparklr.
It's basically fancy talk for "rules for using this site."

We'll try to keep this short and sweet. If you have any questions, concerns, etc., feel free to contact us at team@sparklr.me.

By using Sparklr ("the website", "the service", you get the idea), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions, you cannot use Sparklr.

# These terms may change as the service changes or grows
We have to cover ourselves. If we find we need to change these terms, we will notify you before hand.

# You must be 13 years or older to use Sparklr.
For legal reasons. Sorry.

# Access to Sparklr and/or its content can change at any time
We will do our best to notify users of any changes to the service, but as the service evolves, we must reserve the right to change how the service works, what it does, how it is accessed, et cetera.

# Keep us out of trouble
You agree to indemnify Sparklr, its users, its creators, and anyone affiliated with the service, name, etc. We, the creators, offer no warranty. Also, if you get hurt, incur damages, or something to that tune, its not our fault. Plain and simple. 

# No illegal content 
Any and all content you share or submit to Sparklr must be legally your content or within the bounds accepted under copyright law. You cannot submit content that you do not own, or do not have permission to use. We reserve the right to remove any such content. We also waive any claims about such content to you. Simply put, if you submit a copyrighted picture of Justin Bieber and the men in big suits come after us, we hold you accountable for submitting illegal content. Guys in big suits, you know how this works.

Also, all content submitted must be considered legal under United States laws. You cannot submit, share, etc., any content that would be illegal within this country. Examples are, but are not limited to, child pornography, threatening messages, hate speech, etc. Such content is not to be submitted to Sparklr.

# Be a decent person 
We reserve the right to remove or suspend any user from the service who causes any other users to feel unwelcome, threatened, unsafe, etc. You don't have to love everyone, but you certainly don't have to try and harm others, either.

# Get off my lawn 
We reserve the right to remove or suspend any user at any time, for any reason. We also reserve the right to disable access to Sparklr and its related services to anyone for any reason. If you think that sounds harsh, try reading any other terms of service.

# Have fun
While having fun is not a requirement for using the services, ending the TOS document on a grim note seemed depressing, so this paragraph exists purely for the sake of padding.
